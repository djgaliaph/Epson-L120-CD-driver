<div class="body-text">Do you know that you can influence the impact you have on the environment when printing?</div>

<div class="body-text">1. The type of paper you use has an influence on the environmental impact of your printer. Choosing paper certified under environmental stewardship initiatives, such as EN 12281:2002, or carrying recognised ecolabels, can help reduce your impact on the environment through the initiatives the manufacturers implement. For specific applications, lighter paper, such as 64 g/m&sup2; paper, can be used. </div>

<div class="body-text">2. You can reduce your power consumption by purchasing Energy Star compliant products. </div>

<div class="body-text">3. You can reduce your paper consumption and the impact on the environment by automatically printing on both sides of the page. </div>

<div class="body-text">4. As standard, your printer has a power management function that powers down your product when not in use, which is a great energy saving feature. </div>
