<h3>How to solve your network status or connection problems</h3>
<ol>
	<li>View the Network Connection Report that you printed out. Check items in <b>A</b> (Check Network Connection) for which the status shows FAIL.
	<li>In the Check Items list, click the items that show a FAIL status to display the solutions.
	<li>Check the message displayed in <b>B</b> and look for the same message listed under each Check Item. Then follow the solutions.

The messages above are displayed when the selected or entered wireless network name (SSID) is not found during network setup.<br>
SSID is the name of your Wi-Fi network. If you are using an access point, then your network already had a name when the access point was set up.<br>
If you want to connect your printer and the PC directly without an access point (Ad Hoc connection), you need to setup an Ad Hoc network for your PC. In this case, you need to create an SSID on your PC. <br>
If you do not know your SSID, we recommend that you contact the person or company that set up your network. <br>
Also, you need to place your printer close to the access point (or PC) during setup so that the printer receives a clear signal from the access point or PC.

Check the printer's IP address and check whether or not the network printer can access other devices on the network. In some cases, the error cannot be specified. We recommend performing network setup using EpsonNet Setup.

<br>
<div class="body-t"><b>About network addresses:</b></div>
	<div class="body-i">
	The IP address not only indicates the devices connected to the network such as PC, hub, and router but also the network range they belong to. Devices on the same network can communicate with each other. If you wish to communicate with devices on a different network, a router is required. An IP address consists of two parts. The first part is called the "network address" and indicates the network range. The second part is called the "host address" and indicates the network device. The line between the network address and the host address differs according to the scale (class) of the network. However you can define the line between the network address and the host address using the subnet mask. <br>
	If you are using your printer on a home network, set the printer's IP address setting to "Auto" when using the access point's DHCP function. If you want to use "Manual" to set the printer's IP address, see the following to set the IP address and subnet mask.
	<ol><li>Check the IP address for the router (or access point) connected to your PC. For details, see the instruction manual for the router (or access point).
		<li>All IP addresses are written in segments of four numerical values (for IPv4). In the final segment, set a unique numerical value within a range of 1 to 254. (When the router is a DHCP server or when there is another DHCP server in the home network, set a value that does not conflict with the IP address allocated by the DHCP server.)
	</ol>
	<b>Setting example:</b><br>
	IP address for the router (or access point): 192.168.1.<b>1</b><br>
	Example setting on the printer: 192.168.1.<b>3</b><br>
	If you are using your printer in a small-scale network, <b>255.255.255.0</b> is set for all network devices for the subnet mask. Also, the gateway uses the same value as the IP address for the access point.
